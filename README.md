That is a record of final project of AI-Applied-in-Transport.
The section named Traffic/Flow predict includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, data split(into areas and into training/test datasets ), data normalization and demensionally and model training for regression and nueral network.
To running this section, we need to upload training dataset on the colab.
After running this section, we can get the best parameters for models.
Then, you can use the final evaluation data as input dataset to evaluate the best model that we selected. 
The specific steps are as follows:
1. upload evalutation dataset to colab
2. run section named Final Evaluation.
3. the result wil be showed and the best model for each area will be saved in the colab temporary files.
